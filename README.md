### TODO

- Maybe convert /articles/ to /projects/.
- Update favicon.ico.
- Should main body text of the supporting, thankyou, 404, etc. pages be centre aligned or left aligned like the article pages? Although scrolling is possible, it would only make a difference if the text was long, at which point the page would become an article. Pages such as these should only have a sentence or two on them at most.
- Add DynamicScaling to width/max-width of columns/divs (including index, supporting, and articles).
- Add table of contents button to articles. May be problematic for smart phones as there would need to be some way of scrolling through the menu.
- Continue to update articles.css.
  - Add line numbers for `<code>`.
  - Add line bars for code `<code>`.
- Change trademark.
