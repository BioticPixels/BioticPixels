## TODO

- articles/index.html
- Maybe convert /articles/ to /projects/
- Make favicon.ico
- Perhaps make a donation/"Supporting" page (allows links to the page for information on how to donate (such as a link on this page - a PayPal button is not possible for text documents, but a link to a page is)) (text on main page can contain a link to the "Supporting" page rather than a direct PayPal donation button) (text of the "Supporting" page can be centred and centre aligned, and in a thin column (not unlike the article page (which may only be different in the centre align aspect))
- Add DynamicScaling to width/max-width of columns/divs (including index, supporting, and articles)
- Add table of contents button to articles
- Fix articles.css
- Add line numbers for `<code>`
- Add line bars for code `<code>`
